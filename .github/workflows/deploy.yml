# This file can be deleted - Vercel handles deployment automatically
# through GitHub integration when connected to your repository.
# 
# To enable automatic deployment:
# 1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
# 2. Vercel will automatically deploy on every push to main/master
# 3. No additional configuration needed
#
# This approach is simpler and more reliable than GitHub Actions
