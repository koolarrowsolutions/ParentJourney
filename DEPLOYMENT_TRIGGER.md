# Deployment Trigger

Last updated: January 6, 2025 at 7:40 AM

This file is used to trigger fresh deployments to Vercel when the comprehensive landing page needs to be deployed.

## Current Status
- Comprehensive landing page with AI coaching examples: ✅ Ready
- Logo file (Untitled design (7)_1754459449497.png): ✅ Available
- All features implemented: ✅ Complete

## Issue Resolution
The deployment issue was caused by Vercel using an older commit (166f2e6) that predates the comprehensive landing page implementation. This trigger file will force a new commit to ensure the latest code gets deployed.
