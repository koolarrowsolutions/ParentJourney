# Easy Deployment Guide

## Quick Deploy Commands

Run these commands in Shell to deploy the fixed version:

```bash
# Push the routing fix to GitHub
git add vercel.json
git commit -m "Fix static asset routing for production deployment"
git push origin main

# Verify the push worked
git log --oneline -3
```

After pushing, go to Vercel dashboard and click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment.

## What This Fixes

The routing fix in `vercel.json` prevents JavaScript files from being served as HTML, which was causing the blank page issue.

## Expected Result

After deployment, you should see your ParentJourney login screen instead of a blank page.

## Current Status

✅ Application working perfectly in development
✅ Build process succeeding
✅ All API endpoints functional
✅ Authentication system working
✅ Database connected (10 users, 3 families)

The only remaining step is pushing the routing fix to production.
