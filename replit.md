### Database Schema
The application uses two main tables:

**Child Profiles (`child_profiles`)**:
- `id`: Primary key (UUID)
- `name`: Child's name (required)
- `date_of_birth`: Date of birth (required)
- `gender`: Optional gender field ("male", "female", "other", or null)
- `notes`: Optional notes about the child
- `personality_traits`: Array of selected personality trait keys (up to 7)
- `created_at`: Timestamp for profile creation

**Journal Entries (`journal_entries`)**:
- `id`: Primary key (UUID)
- `title`: Optional entry title
- `content`: Required entry content
- `mood`: Optional mood tracking with emoji
- `child_profile_id`: Foreign key to child_profiles (optional)
- `ai_feedback`: Optional AI-generated feedback
- `developmental_insight`: Age-specific developmental insights
- `has_ai_feedback`: Flag indicating if AI feedback was requested/generated
- `photos`: Array of base64-encoded photos attached to entry
- `created_at`: Timestamp for entry creation

## Data Flow

1. **Journal Entry Creation**:
   - User fills out form with title, content, mood, and AI feedback preference
   - Client validates data using Zod schema
   - Server creates entry and optionally generates AI feedback
   - Client updates UI with new entry and feedback

2. **Child Profile Management**:
   - Users can create, edit, and delete child profiles
   - Each profile stores name, date of birth, gender (optional), notes, and personality traits
   - Age calculation from date of birth for developmental insights
   - Personality trait selection (up to 7) with age-appropriate traits shown
   - Separate trait update dialog for easy periodic updates as children grow
   - Child selection when creating journal entries

3. **AI Feedback Generation**:
   - Uses OpenAI GPT-4o model for generating parenting insights
   - Structured prompt provides validation, suggestions, growth insights, and summary
   - JSON response format ensures consistent feedback structure

4. **Developmental Insights**:
   - Age-specific parenting insights based on child development research
   - Automatically generated when a child profile is selected
   - Covers all developmental stages from infancy to young adulthood
   - Personalized based on selected personality traits for the child

5. **Data Retrieval**:
   - Client fetches journal entries with optional limit parameter
   - Server returns entries sorted by creation date (newest first)
   - Child profiles linked to journal entries for context
   - Client caches responses using TanStack Query
